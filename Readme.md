# Configly

Configly is a class-based, object-orient (OO) library for ES6+. Configly embraces the
embattled JavaScript `class` keyword and ES.next decorators to bring powerful new abilities
to classes.

## Classes

As the name "Configly" implies, the goal is to make classes (and their instances as
described below) more flexible or configurable. This starts at the class-level by allowing
classes to be augmented in several ways:

 - mixins
 - method junctions
 - method chains
 - extensible processors


### Mixins

#### Method Junctions

#### Method Chains

### Class Processors
